					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Several months after writing my first Hello World program in Python on September 8th 2022, I had convinced my brother to let me take a stab at building a full stack responsive webapp for better management of his salon business.</p>

					<p>In few days, I had built a full stack responsive webapp with python and django framework where client can book an appointment, join exclusive levels of membership, get notification for potential salon visit day using their past visits and activities and many other functionalities for seamless operation of the business.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps at every opportunity to be better.</p>
